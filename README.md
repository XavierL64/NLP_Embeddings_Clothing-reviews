# NLP_Embeddings_Clothing-reviews

This project aims to analyse customer reviews for a clothing e-commerce business. It leverages text embeddings and the OpenAI API to understand customer sentiment by categorising reviews and finding similar reviews using cosine similarity.  

The analysis focuses on column 'Review Text' from the womens_clothing_e-commerce_reviews dataset. The column contains textual feedback provided by customers about their shopping experience and product quality.
